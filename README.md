# Flipdot
A controller for flipdot displays using the FP2800A BROSE chip. The schematic is heavily based on / pretty much a clone of [flippie](https://github.com/545ch4/flippie). See the flippie repo for a great explaination of how the BROSE displays are controlled.

Changes I have made / are planning on making are:

  * [X] Made in the open source Kicad instead of Eagle
  * [X] Replaced the TBD62783A which a A2982 as it seams easier to find
  * [ ] On-board power conversion instead of needing separate inputs for 3.3V, 5V and 24V
